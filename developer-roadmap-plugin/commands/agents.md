## How Agents Help

Each agent will:

1. **Assess your background** - Understand your current level
2. **Set learning goals** - Define clear objectives
3. **Build learning paths** - Step-by-step guidance
4. **Recommend resources** - Tutorials, courses, tools
5. **Provide feedback** - Answer questions in real-time
6. **Track progress** - Keep you accountable

## Integration Between Agents

Agents work together for your success:

```
Language Agent
    ↓ (provides foundation)
Web/Mobile/Data Agent
    ↓ (uses fundamentals)
Cloud/Architecture Agent
    ↓ (deploys solutions)
Specialized Agent
    ↓ (manages/grows solutions)
```

## Examples

```
Web Developer Path:
1. /agents language (JavaScript, fundamentals)
2. /agents web (React, Node.js)
3. /agents architecture (API design, databases)
4. /agents cloud (deployment to AWS)
5. /agents specialized (product thinking, management)

Data Scientist Path:
1. /agents language (Python, math foundations)
2. /agents data (ML, Data Engineering)
3. /agents cloud (MLOps, Kubernetes)
4. /agents specialized (Product thinking, leadership)
```

## Next Steps
