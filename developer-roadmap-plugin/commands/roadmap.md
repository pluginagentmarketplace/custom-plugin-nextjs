## How It Works

When you use `/roadmap [role]`, I will:

1. **Guide you through the roadmap** - Explain the learning path step-by-step
2. **Show prerequisites** - What you should know before starting
3. **Provide resources** - Links to tutorials, courses, and tools
4. **Suggest timeline** - Estimated time to reach proficiency
5. **Offer next steps** - Projects and practical exercises

## Example

```
/roadmap react

→ React Developer Roadmap

## Tips

- **Start simple**: Begin with fundamentals, don't skip steps
- **Build projects**: Apply knowledge by building real projects
- **Practice consistently**: 1-2 hours daily is better than 8 hours once/week
- **Join communities**: GitHub Discussions, Reddit, Discord for support
- **Combine roadmaps**: Learn complementary technologies together
